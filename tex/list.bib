    Abstract = {  We present lazy expansion, a new algorithm for scalable test
  input generation using directed concolic execution.  Lazy expansion
  is an instantiation of the counterexample-guided refinement paradigm
  from static software verification in the context of testing.  Our
  algorithm works in two phases.  It first explores, using concolic
  execution, an abstraction of the function under test by replacing
  each called function with an unconstrained input.  Second, for each
  (possibly spurious) trace generated by this abstraction, it attempts
  to expand the trace to a concretely realizable execution by
  recursively expanding the called functions and finding concrete
  executions in the called functions that can be stitched together
  with the original trace to form a complete program execution.  Thus,
  it reduces the burden of symbolic reasoning about interprocedural
  paths to reasoning about intraprocedural paths (in the exploration
  phase), together with a localized and constrained search through
  functions (in the concretization phase).

  Lazy expansion is particularly effective in testing functions that
  make more-or-less independent calls to lower level library functions
  (that have already been unit tested), by only exploring relevant
  paths in the function under test.  We have implemented our algorithm
  on top of the CUTE concolic execution tool for C and applied it to
  testing parser code in small compilers.  In preliminary experiments,
  our tool, called LATEST, outperformed CUTE by an order of
  magnitude in terms of the time taken to generate inputs, and in
  contrast to CUTE, produced many syntactically valid input strings
  which exercised interesting paths through the compiler (rather than
  only the parser error handling code).}

  abstract = {
  This paper introduces a methodology to perform formal verification
  of floating-point C programs. It extends an existing tool for the
  verification of C programs, Caduceus, with new annotations specific
  to floating-point arithmetic. The Caduceus first-order logic model
  for C programs is extended accordingly. Then verification conditions
  expressing the correctness of the programs are obtained in the usual
  way and can be discharged interactively with the Coq proof
  assistant, using an existing Coq formalization of floating-point
  arithmetic.  This methodology is already implemented and has been
  successfully applied to several short floating-point programs, which
  are presented in this paper.}

    abstract = {This note defines {BoogiePL}, an intermediate language for program analysis and program verification. The language is a simple coarsely typed imperative language with procedures and arrays, plus support for introducing mathematical functions and declaring properties of these functions. {BoogiePL} can be used to represent programs written in an imperative source language (like an object-oriented .{NET} language), along with a logical encoding of the semantics of such a source language. From the resulting {BoogiePL} program, one can then generate verification conditions or perform other program analyses such as the inference of program invariants. In this way, {BoogiePL} also serves as a programming-notation front end to theorem provers. {BoogiePL} is accepted as input to Boogie, the Spec\# static program verifier.},

The analysis has automatic inference of loop invariants and method pre-/post-conditions, and efficient checking of analysis results by a simple checker. Invariants, which can be large, can be specialized for proving a safety policy using an automatic pruning technique which reduces their size. The result of the analysis can be checked efficiently by annotating the program with parts of the invariant together with certificates of polyhedral inclusions, which allow to avoid certain complex polyhedral computation such as the convex hull of two polyhedra. Small, easily checkable inclusion certificates are obtained using Farkas lemma for proving the absence of solutions to systems of linear inequalities. The resulting checker is sufficiently simple to be entirely certified within the Coq proof assistant.}},

abstract ={Systems as diverse as genetic networks or the World Wide Web are best described as networks with complex topology. A common property of many large networks is that the vertex connectivities follow a scale-free power-law distribution. This feature was found to be a consequence of two generic mechanisms: (i) networks expand continuously by the addition of new vertices, and (ii) new vertices attach preferentially to sites that are already well connected. A model based on these two ingredients reproduces the observed stationary scale-free distributions, which indicates that the development of large networks is governed by robust self-organizing phenomena that go beyond the particulars of the individual systems.},

                 entirely in hardware, or in any combination of software
                 and hardware. For operations specified in the normative
                 part of this standard, numerical results and exceptions
                 are uniquely determined by the values of the input
